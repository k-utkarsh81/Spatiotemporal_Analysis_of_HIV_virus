# Spatiotemporal Analysis of HIV Virus

## üß† Motivation

This project aims to bridge global health disparities by predicting life expectancy using machine learning and geospatial tools. It focuses on how socio-economic and environmental factors influence life expectancy, especially concerning HIV spread. The end goal is to support better public health policy-making using data-driven visual tools.
